The final code is in "main_visual_mode_ver_2_mod.py" feel free to play with any of the code for learning purposes or just to play the game, just don't try to use my code to take credit for yourself(I may change this criteria at later point of time). I hereby give credit to "iamloghin" for using his images and audios for my project. Nevertheless suggestions are always welcome.
